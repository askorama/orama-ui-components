## Introduction

Welcome to the **Orama UI Components Library**! This library provides a set of reusable UI components for easily implementing search functionalities in your web applications.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with our components, you need to install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install @orama/ui-components
# TODO: placeholder
```

### Authentication

1. **Sign Up**: Go to [Our Signup Page](https://cloud.oramasearch.com/auth/signup) and create an account.
2. **Create your first index**: You can even create a Demo index to start playing around

## Components

### Chatbox: `Chatbox`

**Description**: This component enables you to swiftly set up an entire Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system in just under 3 minutes. It leverages the answer engine to enhance content generation.
