# React

We offer a React version of every public component so you can use them in your React projects.

## Installation

To add the Orama UI Kit to your React project, run:

```bash
npm install @orama/react-components
```
You can use pnpm or yarn if you prefer.

## Usage

In your `App.tsx` file, import the component definition and use it in your JSX:

```tsx
import { defineCustomElements } from '@orama/react-components'

void defineCustomElements()
```

You can then import and use the components you need in your project:

```tsx
import { OramaChatBox } from '@orama/react-components'

export const App = () => (
  <OramaChatBox
    index={{
      api_key: 'your index api key',
      endpoint: 'your index endpoint',
    }}
  />
)
```
